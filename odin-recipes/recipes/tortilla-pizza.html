    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an extremely easy/fast way to prepare a delicious pizza that is
      light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good
      that is can be devoured alone! I make this often when entertaining guests
      and it always goes fast. You can make any sort of topping variations. The
      one below is the classic way I usually prepare it. I cook this also with
      my family. Each person gets their own tortilla to, as my kids say,
      decorate.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 inch) soft flour tortilla</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 cooked chicken breast, sliced</li>
      <li>½ green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Place tortilla on a baking sheet. Brush with olive oil; sprinkle garlic
      powder, salt, and pepper on top.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove tortilla
      from the oven and spread tomato sauce on top. Arrange chicken breast,
      green bell pepper, and green onions over tomato sauce; cover with
      mozzarella cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
      Sprinkle oregano over cheese. Slice pizza into wedges using a pizza
      cutter.
